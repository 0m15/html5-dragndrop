HTML5-dragndrop
===============

Simple experiment with html5 native drag and drop.

How to run
----------

Serve the repository folder.

I personally use::

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

..

but you can use whatever you want to serve the files.

Then browse to http://localhost:8000.

CSS note
--------

I am using google's closure-stylesheets to generate the css file (css/chess.gss) but you can edit chess.css directly.
